This folder contains quick scaffolds for adding React, Vue, and Tailwind-based versions of your portfolio.

- React: scaffolds/react — Vite + React + Tailwind steps and sample `Skills` component.
- Vue: scaffolds/vue — Vite + Vue 3 + Tailwind steps and sample `Skills` component.
- Tailwind: scaffolds/tailwind — How to add Tailwind to your existing HTML/CSS site.

If you'd like, I can create full runnable projects from these scaffolds and install dependencies.
